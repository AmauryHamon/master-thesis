# Starting Point 
	- What is the ecosystem of tools and platforms used by creatives for visual research, ideas, learning, teaching and sharing? 
	- How opinionated is their choice of such tools?
	- How creatives use such tools in unusual ways?
	- Can this critically influence their creative practice?

- Monetized Social Media: Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram…
	- Editorial: Dedicated editorial/academic websites
	- Personal Vault: TiddlyWiki, Obsidian, Zotero, Notion, etc.
	- Self-made with code
	- Are.na

#### Hypothesis
	\
	Using open-ended tools like are.na or digital gardening extends an opportunity for creatives to develop a more open & collaborative process, encouraging an alternative from streams of data in mainstream social media platforms.
---
	Why does it matter?
	- Alternative and resistance to algorithmically-filtered ephemeral streams of content
	- Reclaim and grow over time your own space of the	 internet = More agency and ownership to the user and their data
	- Design-wise: Step away from standardised webdesign layouts, open-ended means possibility to customise tools
	- Mindful Community behaviour around information
	- Hacker Ethic: all information should be free
	- Public learning: sharing what you learn as you're learning it 

---
	Digital Gardening?
	- web as topology/space, not a timeline
	- collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date (not a blog)
	- exploratory – content linked through contextual associations
	- not finite – grow and evolve over time. 
	- accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information
	- less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing
