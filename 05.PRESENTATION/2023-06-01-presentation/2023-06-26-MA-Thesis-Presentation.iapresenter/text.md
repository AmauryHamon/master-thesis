## Starting point
	Which online tools are used by artists and designers for inspiration and research? Which ones allow collaborative approaches to sharing/organising knowledge? 
	\
	A possibility is nurturing the commons and creating/using tools for cooperation and exchange. One in particular is digital gardening one's knowledge, with tools such as Are.na

	A *Digital Garden*
	is an evolving collection of interconnected ideas, notes, and resources that are organized and shared online. It serves as a platform for personal knowledge management and allows for non-linear exploration and collaboration.

	*Post-Capital* 
	refers to a theoretical framework that envisions a future beyond the capitalist economic system. It explores alternative models that prioritize sustainability, social justice, and collective well-being, aiming to address the inherent flaws and inequalities of capitalism.

	*Surveillance Capitalism* 
	refers to the economic system where companies profit by collecting and analyzing massive amounts of personal data from individuals for targeted advertising and behavioral manipulation. It involves the exploitation of digital surveillance technologies to commodify and monetize people's private information. (Cf. Shoshana Zuboff)

	*Public Learning* 
	refers to the process of acquiring knowledge and skills through open and inclusive educational practices that are accessible to a wider community. It emphasizes collaboration, shared resources, and collective participation to foster lifelong learning and empower individuals in a public setting.

	*Attention Economy* 
	refers to the economic system in which attention becomes a scarce and valuable resource. In this system, companies compete for individuals' attention through various platforms and services, often relying on techniques like targeted advertising and addictive design to capture and hold attention for financial gain.

	*Knowledge commoning* 
	refers to the practice of collectively creating, sharing, and stewarding knowledge as a commons. It involves the collaborative and community-driven effort to generate and maintain a shared pool of knowledge resources, often through open and participatory processes that prioritize accessibility and collective ownership.

## Research Question: 
	How can digital gardening tools and collaborative research platforms help cultivating alternative creative practices in surveillance capitalism?

	Why are.na and why it echoes digital gardening?
	- the tool I personally use everyday
	- founded by artists, for artists
	- Alternative and resistance to algorithmically-filtered ephemeral streams of content
	- exploratory – content linked through contextual associations
	- accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information
	- open-ended for various purposes with API (custom sites)
	- Mindful Community behaviour around information
	- Can be fully collaborative, open or private
---
#### Hypothesis
	\
	Digital gardening and using open-ended tools like are.na  extends an opportunity for creatives to nurture a more open & collaborative process, encouraging an alternative to streams of monetised data.

---
#### Observation Methods #2
	- (REMOTE) Interviewing digital gardeners and are.na users (zoom, screensharing) documenting their various use, opinion on curating and sharing knowledge, limits and risks of such platforms? Influence on their practice?
	- (PHYSICAL) Direct observation: monitoring a user's exploratory journey on are.na: how one element meets another and how they are connected and contextualized by the user

	Pertinent example uses of are.na
	- classroom collaboration
	- personal curation
	- ideas and note-taking
	- moodboards
	- personal portfolio
	- public learning
	- CMS via API
	…
