# Research Question: 
How can digital gardening tools and collaborative research platforms help cultivating alternative creative practices in surveillance capitalism?

## Starting point (before setting the research question)
Which online tools are used by artists and designers for organisation, inspiration and research? Which ones allow collaborative approaches to sharing/organising knowledge? Making bridges and contextual nodes between disparate informations to spark ideas and creation.

## Hypothesis to the research question
Digital gardening and using open-ended tools like are.na extends an opportunity for creatives to nurture a more open & collaborative process, encouraging an alternative to streams of monetised data.
