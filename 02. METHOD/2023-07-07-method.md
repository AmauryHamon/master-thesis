2. Focus: Digital gardens and the platform are.na
    - List of Digital Gardens:
        - ...
    - Are.na (i.e Why are.na and why it echoes digital gardening?)
        - the tool I personally use everyday
        - founded by artists, for artists
        - Alternative and resistance to algorithmically-filtered ephemeral streams of content
        - exploratory – content linked through contextual associations
        - accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information
        - open-ended for various purposes with API (custom sites)
        - Mindful Community behaviour around information
        - Can be fully collaborative, open or private
    - Pertinent example uses of are.na
        - classroom collaboration
        - personal curation
        - free-writing and note-taking
        - moodboards
        - personal portfolio
        - public learning
        - CMS via API
        …

3. Data Collecting Method: Interviews
    Interviewing at least a dozen creatives about their personal online toolbox that allow them to think, research, create and collaborate.
    - (REMOTE) Interviewing digital gardeners and are.na users (zoom, screensharing) documenting their various use, opinion on curating and sharing knowledge, limits and risks of such platforms? Influence on their practice?
    - (PHYSICAL) Direct observation: monitoring a user's exploratory journey on are.na: how one element meets another and how they are connected and contextualized by the user
